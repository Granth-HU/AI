        <h2>Draft Strategy</h2>
        <p>Drafting well is the foundation of a successful fantasy football season. A balanced approach is key—prioritize elite running backs early since they tend to have the most consistent workloads. However, don't neglect top-tier wide receivers, especially in PPR leagues where receptions add significant value. Quarterbacks and tight ends can often be found in later rounds unless you want a high-end player like Patrick Mahomes or Travis Kelce.</p>
        <p>Understanding positional value and depth is crucial. Running backs drop off quickly in production after the first two rounds, so securing one or two early can set you apart. Meanwhile, late-round steals, like breakout wide receivers or committee backs, can provide depth and upside. Always be flexible and adapt to how the draft unfolds.</p>

        <h2>In-Season Management</h2>
        <p>Winning in fantasy football isn't just about the draft; active in-season management makes all the difference. Keep a close eye on the waiver wire for emerging players, especially after injuries create opportunities for backups. Streaming quarterbacks and defenses based on matchups can also give you a weekly edge.</p>
        <p>Trading smartly can significantly improve your roster. Look for opportunities to "buy low" on underperforming stars or "sell high" on players exceeding their usual production. Pay attention to schedules, especially during the fantasy playoffs, as favorable matchups can be a game-changer when it matters most.</p>
